The most effective general purpose compression algorithms areadaptive, in that the text represented by each compression symbol is determined dynamically by the data. As a result, the encoding of a substring depends on its location. Thus the same substring may},

@article{Mukherjee2005,
abstract = {In recent times, we have witnessed an unprecedented growth of textual information via the Internet, digital libraries and archival text in many applications. To be able to store, manage, organize and transport the data efficiently, text compression is necessary. We also need efficient search engines to speedily find the information from this huge mass of data, especially when it is compressed. In this chapter, we present a review of text compression algorithms, with particular emphasis on the LZ family algorithms, and present our current research on the family of Star compression algorithms. We discuss ways to search the information from its compressed format and introduce some recent work on compressed domain pattern matching, with a focus on a new two-pass compression algorithm based on LZW algorithm. We present the architecture of a compressed domain search and retrieval system for archival information and indicate its suitability for implementation in a parallel and distributed environment using random access property of the two-pass LZW algorithm. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Assume a finite alphabet of constant symbols and a disjoint infinite alphabet of variable symbols. A pattern is a non-null finite string of constant and variable symbols. The language of a pattern is all strings obtainable by substituting non-null strings of constant symbols for the variables of the pattern. A sample is a finite nonempty set of non-null strings of constant symbols. Given a sample S, a pattern p is descriptive of S provided the language of p contains S and does not properly contain the language of any other pattern that contains S. The computational problem of finding a pattern descriptive of a given sample is studied. The main result is a polynomial-time algorithm for the special case of patterns containing only one variable symbol (possibly occurring several times in the pattern). Several other results are proved concerning the class of languages generated by patterns and the problem of finding a descriptive pattern.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of calculating minimum-redundancy codes for alphabets in which there is significant repetition of symbol weights. On a sorted-by-weight alphabet of, n symbols and r distinct symbol weights we show that a minimum-redundancy prefix code can be constructed in O(r+r log(n/r)) time, and that a minimum redundancy L-bit length-limited prefix code can be constructed in O(Lr+Lrlog(n/r)) time. When r is small relative to n-which is necessarily the case for most practical coding problems on large alphabets-these bounds represent a substantial improvement upon the best previous algorithms for these two problems, which consumed O(n) time and O(nL) time, respectively. The improved algorithms are also space-efficient},

abstract = {We address the problem of string matching on Ziv-Lempel compressed text. The goal is to search a pattern in a text without uncompressing it. This is a highly relevant issue to keep compressed text databases where efficient searching is still possible. We develop a general technique for string matching when the text comes as a sequence of blocks. This abstracts the essential features of Ziv-Lempel compression. We then apply the scheme to each particular type of compression. We present the first algorithm to find all the matches of a pattern in a text compressed using LZ77. When we apply our scheme to LZ78, we obtain a much more efficient search algorithm, which is faster than uncompressing the text and then searching on it. Finally, we propose a new hybrid compression scheme which is between LZ77 and LZ78, being in practice as good to compress as LZ77 and as fast to search in as LZ78.},
